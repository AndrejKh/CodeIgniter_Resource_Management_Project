# Resource-Managment-System

This project was part of a 3rd Year group project at Heriot Watt Univercity.  

The project's breif was to create a resource managment system in which a companies staff could be alocated to diffrent projectes depending on their varying skill levels, experiance, location and availabilty.  

The system was created using a mix of PHP and the CodeIgniter Framework (github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter) and SQL, JavaScript, Jquery, Bootstrap and HTML.
