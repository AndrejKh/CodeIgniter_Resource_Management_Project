###Profile Edit Notes
In the future, possibly use ajax to auto update profile when double clicking on a field
Example is LinkedIn profile page


###Base Url Note 
Commented the base url to be used until final/demo release as this would hardset the user directory being used, and would make having local copies of the app on our own directories broken as every time the base url was printed, it would send the browser to another version of the app
